<details><summary>Does Twind work with XYZ framework or library?</summary>
If your project uses JavaScript/TypeScript, it should work with Twind. This includes vanilla JavaScript/TypeScript, React, React Native, Vue, Angular, Solid, AlpineJS, NextJS, Gatsby, Nuxt, 11ty, and virtually any other JavaScript framework.

Please note that usage with some frameworks, including SSR frameworks, requires additional configuration. We've put together several [recipes](#) and [example apps](#) to get you started:

<details><summary>How do I write raw CSS in Twind?</summary>

Tailwind provides a `twind/css` package to help you incorporate raw CSS into your project. This package exposes a  `css` function that lets you define your CSS using JavaScript object notation. [Learn more in the docs](https://twind.dev/docs/modules/twind_css.html).

<details><summary>How do I override a style in Twind?</summary>
Coming soon...
</details>
<details><summary>How do I access a theme value in Twind?</summary>

The  `twind/css` package exposes a `theme` helper for use with the `css` function. [View the docs](https://twind.dev/docs/modules/twind.html#theme-helper) here.

</details>

<details><summary>How do I use Twind with server-rendered (SSR) apps?</summary>

Twind provides a `twind/server` package to assist with static extraction needed for SSR apps. [Learn more in the docs.](https://twind.dev/docs/modules/twind_server.html)

There is also a working [example Next App](https://github.com/tw-in-js/example-next) to get you up in running.

<details><summary>How do I cache my Twind styles?</summary>

</details>

<details><summary>When should I use the shim and are there any downsides?</summary>

The purpose of the shim is to allow you to take advantage of Twind without the use of the `tw` function. This is useful for certain situations:
- You are incrementally refactoring an existing Tailwind app.
- You just want to get up and running quickly (prototyping)

There could be performance implications of using the shim on large or highly dynamic apps due to a requirement to parse entire class attributes. However, these differences should be negligible for most static sites.
